# Description

<p align="center">
    🛡️ <strong>Discover the Red Team Way</strong>
</p>

We've meticulously crafted this methodology to elevate the hacking prowess of security researchers. It provides a glimpse into how BHEH's Red Team conducts bug bounty missions. It's never about the certificates you earn; it's about the authentic experience you gain. The real world is far more intricate than practice. Companies bolster their security, investing substantial resources to safeguard, detect, and respond. Yet, this methodology remains triumphant, garnering us numerous successful bug bounty awards.

While our techniques may evolve over time due to emerging tools and methods, this foundation forms the cornerstone for all reconnaissance, essential to crafting a precise vector of attacks. Recon and OSINT constitute 90% of the work, with attacks comprising the rest. Don't lose heart; persevere, practice diligently, educate yourself, and embrace continuous learning. This journey requires time, dedication, and unwavering consistency. Remember, you're driven by passion, not just monetary gain. You're demonstrating how a 1337 ethical hacker dismantles defenses to make a point and earn recognition.

If all bug bounty hunters adopt this methodology, results will echo. By refining your techniques, investing more time in Recon, and elevating quality, you'll outshine others. Expect fewer duplicates and focus on more challenging targets.

#### Bounty Platform used:

## [Hexway](https://hexway.io/hive)
- We respect the privacy of clients we are working on Hackerone.com & use only passive techniques, we do not share anything related to security misconfigurations, and everything is taken from passive resources, including the techniques performed. 
- The purpose is for Educational only!
- We will update the list everytime we add/remove tools.
- Some of the Methodologies we use during our Stream, since we had many requests to post it, here you go:

#### As seen on Hackerone.com Passive Bounty Focused for Quick Pwning:

## Project Notes & Recon Approach Techniques:

**Main Domain:**
`XXXX Enter from Scope XXXX`

**Secondary `*.*` Domains:**
`XXXX Enter from Scope XXXX`

**Single Sub-domains:**
`XXXX Enter from Scope XXXX`

**Passive Recon Techniques:**
- You can use also [BHEH-SUB-PWNER](https://github.com/blackhatethicalhacking/bheh-sub-pwner) New!

**First things first:**

1. Create Folders (Subdomains, URLS, IPs)
2. Recon-ng - Recon Passively for subdomains/ips/ports/params/js
3. Export lists from recon-ng and use httpx to create urls/probing (urls/IPs/Subdomains)
4. Use isup.sh to filter ips 

**UPLOAD ALL RESULTS INTO PLATFORM**

> `Note`: If you see domain.* you have to use the below technique, check this file:

[TLD Wordlist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gingeleski/b01633b07183ff572198dd7e31bbd4b0/raw/5e015d43b4e7b692be49fb3f42f03e1693c370bb/domain_extensions_payloads.txt)

Ctrl+H with regex mode enabled and replace ^ with the domain name

Then Use :

[Domain2IP-Converter](https://github.com/blackhatethicalhacking/Domain2IP-Converter)

Then Run subdomains using `httpx` for URLs:

Use `updog` to offer easier workflow when uploading/checking directories locally.

For example when using a Raspberry Pi, or VPS it helps uploading files locally on the machine.

********************************************************************************************************************

#### 5. Use Nmap Aggressive Scan & Save to XML to Import into Bounty Platform:

```
nmap -iL ips.txt -sSV -A -T4 -O -Pn -v -F -oX nmap2.xml
```

**Extra Sn1per - WebApp Mode:**

```
sniper -f /root/Desktop/Bounty/Airbnb/ips/valid-airbnb_ips.txt -m massweb -w airbnbtestweb
```
_**UPLOAD ALL RESULTS INTO PLATFORM**_

Examine Some Services Manually from the Cloud Platform Hive: New!

Use `Metasploit` + `Searchsploit` to manually search - note down certain areas of interest including `Log4j` Patterns.

This could take days/weeks - So, its a _non stop process_.

5b. Extra `Osmedeus` Scan New!

You can use on the list of IP addresses, a domain or list of URLs gathered Osemedeus with UI to go for more in depth recon/attacks on CVEs:

`osmedeus server`

**For the UI:**

Get Credentials from here:

```
cat ~/.osmedeus/config.yaml

...
client:
  password: xxxx
  username: osmedeus
...
```
**Then visit:** `[YOURIP:8000](https://your-vps-ip:8000/ui/)`

## Directly run on vuln scan and directory scan on list of domains 

```
osmedeus scan -f vuln-and-dirb -t list-of-domains.txt
```
## Performing static vulnerability scan and secret scan on a git repo
  
  ```
  osmedeus scan -m repo-scan -t https://github.com/j3ssie/sample-repo
  osmedeus scan -m repo-scan -t /tmp/source-code-folder
  osmedeus scan -m repo-scan -T list-of-repo.txt
  ```
## Scan list of targets 

```
osmedeus scan -T list_of_targets.txt
```

## Get target from a stdin and start the scan with 2 concurrency 
```
cat list_of_targets.txt | osmedeus scan -c 2
```

## Start a simple scan with default 'general' flow 
```
osmedeus scan -t sample.com
```

## One Liner Very Powerful Techniques New! 

**Check for Heartbleed:**

```
cat subdomains.txt | while read line ; do echo "QUIT" | openssl s_client -connect $line:443 2>&1 | grep 'server extension "heartbeat" (id=15)' || echo $line: safe; done
```

**Extract Javascripts from domains, and fetch only the URLS from those big files, can also be used with any type of file containing huge data:**

First use getJs to get the Javascripts:

```
getJS --url website.com --output /root/results.txt
```

```
getJS --input urls.txt --output /root/results.txt
```

**Extract URLs directly or from a file using this one-liner:**

From any type of file:
```
cat file | grep -Eo "(http|https)://[a-zA-Z0-9./?=_-]*"*
```

Directly from a website:
```
curl https://domain.xx/file.js | grep -Eo "(http|https)://[a-zA-Z0-9./?=_-]*"*
```

**OSINT: (Can be done on RPI)**

Check for Domain TakeOver with `Takeover` by M4llok 

Takeover Tool: 
```
takeover -l sub_domains.txt -v -t 10
```

**Check for open Amazon S3 buckets**
```
ls | grep s3 from nuclei-templates/technologies
```

Can use `nuclei -l urls.txt -t /root/nuclei-templates/technologies/s3-detect.yaml`

Attack Buckets: New!

- [s3-buckets-aio-pwn](https://github.com/blackhatethicalhacking/s3-buckets-aio-pwn)

6. Use ParamSpider to Hunt for URLS with Parameters automatically from wayback machine - You can also use `Arjun`, we are switching to `ParamSpider` as part of building a workflow 

```
python3 paramspider.py --domain DOMAINNAME.com --exclude woff,png,svg,php,jpg --output /root/Desktop/Bounty/params.txt
```

Technique to Clean Params from XSS:

```
sed 's/unix/linux/g' reconfile.txt
```
 
7. Use Smuggler on URLs list to test for http requests that could desync, and posting multiple chunked requests to smuggle external sources so the backend server will forward the request with cookies, data to the front end server
   
(Can be done on RPI)

```
cat list_of_urls.txt | python3 smuggler.py -l /root/location.txt
```

**Bonus**

A) Eyewitness to take Screenshots of all URLS, Will run on VPS only! New!

```
eyewitness -f /root/Desktop/Bounty/Client/urls.txt
```

```
zip -r name.zip folder
```

Examine the Results Manually


B) Pattern Check Example for Results with `gf` & `gf-patterns`: 

After you have the Parameters Gathered, we want to check for specific patterns and possible vulnerable URLs that can be attacked using Meg or other Fuzzing Tools.
```
cat /root/Desktop/Bounty/params.txt | gf xss | sed 's/FUZZ/ /g' >> /root/Desktop/Bounty/xss_params_forMeg.txt
```

**Very Powerful One Liner - You can Pipe also directly to Meg:**

Use `Meg` with Seclist fuzzing for Links: (Gathered from `gau/arjun/paramspider/gf`)

For `Meg`, we must remove the ‘FUZZ’ from paramspider and replace it with a null character:

```
sed 's/FUZZ//g' reconfile.txt
```
```
meg -v LFI-gracefulsecurity-linux.txt /root/Desktop/Bounty/urls.txt /root/Desktop/urls.txt -s 200
```

9. `JSScanner`: 

Scanning Javascript Files for Endpoints, Secrets, Hardcoded credentials,IDOR, Openredirect and more

Paste URLS into `alive.txt`

Run script `alive.txt` - Examine the results using GF advanced patterns

Use tree command, cat into subdirectories:
```
cat * */*.txt
cat */*.js | gf api-keys	
cat /*/*.txt | gf ssrf > /root/Desktop/ssrf.txt
```

Or New Method with `GitLeaks`: New!

Scan a Directory with Javascripts, Files, Json Etc.. for Secrets!
```
gitleaks --path=/directory -v --no-git
```

Scan a File with Any Extension for Secrets!
```
gitleaks --path=/file.xxx -v --no-git
```
 
10. Find XSS Vulnerabilities from `Paramspider` & `Dalfox` New!

Since we have params urls from paramspider, dalfox needs to know where to inject, and you can define it with XSS instead of FUZZ, so here is a command to replace this from the result, and create a new list to be used on dalfox.

```
sed 's/FUZZ/XSS/g' reconfile.txt
```

You are now ready for parsing the urls into dalfox in pipe mode:


```
cat /root/Desktop/Bounty/xss_params.txt | dalfox pipe | cut -d " " -f 2 > output.txt
```

or

```
dalfox file /root/Desktop/Bounty/xss_params.txt | cut -d " " -f 2 > output.txt
```

For Deeper Attacks add this:

`--deep-domxss`

Silence `--silence` Prints only PoC When found and progress

10 - After Recon: New!

When you find Keys/Tokens - Check from here: [Keyhacks](https://github.com/streaak/keyhacks)

********************************************************************************************************************

OSINT & Passive Amplified Attacks: (Raspberry Pi)

OSINT:

Perform OSINT using `spiderfoot`

One off **1337** Powerful Command Attacks with `Amass`:

#### 1. Amass into Nuclei:
```
amass enum -passive -d [subdomain] -v | httpx -verbose | nuclei -t /root/nuclei-templates/cves/ -o /root/Desktop/Bounty/location.txt
```

#### 2. Amass into Jaeles:
```
amass enum -passive -d [Domain] -v | httpx -verbose | jaeles scan -s 'cves' -s 'sensitive' -s 'fuzz' -s ‘common' -s 'routines' report -o /root/Desktop/Bounty/reportname.txt --title "[Client] Jaeles Full Report"
```

3. Use Eyewitness to take screenshots from URLs

```
eyewitness -f /root/Desktop/Bounty/Client/urls.txt
```

#### More Tools: `chopchop` / `inception` / `jsql`

```
./gochopchop scan --url-file /root/Desktop/Bounty/urls.txt --threads 4
```

#### Sn1per - Bounty Mode on Active Results

```
sniper -f /root/Desktop/Bounty/Airbnb/ips/valid-airbnb_ips.txt -m massweb -w airbnbtestweb
```

#### RPI Copy:
```
scp -P 7 /root/Desktop/test.txt root@192.168.0.12:/root
```

#### use Gotty - [gotty](https://github.com/yudai/gotty)


```
gotty -p 1337 -w recon-ng 
```

`Gau` - for realtime URL extraction when performing manual search so you can have urls to attack.

Hunt for Links that have Parameters by using gau (Get all URLS) and displaying all links that have params: 

```
cat subdomains.txt | gau | tee /root/Desktop/urls.txt | lolcat
```

```
gau domains -o urls.txt
```

```
gau example.com
```

```
gau -o example-urls.txt example.com
```

```
